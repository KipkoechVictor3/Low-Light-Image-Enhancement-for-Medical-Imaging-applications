This repository provides a MATLAB implementation for analyzing real-world low-light images and detecting common types of noise and artifacts that often occur in such images. These include:

Gaussian noise: Often caused by sensor limitations, particularly in low-light conditions.
Salt-and-pepper noise: Random pixel corruption caused by transmission errors.
Blur: Caused by camera motion, poor focus, or low light.
JPEG compression artifacts: Blocky patterns or distortion resulting from lossy image compression.
The goal of this analysis is to quantify these distortions, enabling better understanding and potential mitigation of image degradation in low-light environments. This approach is useful in various fields, including medical imaging, astronomy, surveillance, and photography, where low-light conditions are common.

Features:
Gaussian Noise Detection: Detects Gaussian noise by calculating the variance of pixel intensities in a smooth region of the image.
Salt-and-Pepper Noise Detection: Identifies salt-and-pepper noise by counting white (salt) and black (pepper) pixels.
Blur Detection: Measures image sharpness using the Laplacian filter to detect blur caused by factors like camera shake or poor focus.
JPEG Artifact Detection: Detects compression artifacts by analyzing block variance across the image.
How It Works:
Image Processing: The code processes each image by first converting it to grayscale and normalizing pixel values.
Noise and Artifact Detection: It calculates specific metrics for each type of noise and artifact.
Results Visualization: The results are displayed as numerical values in a table, and corresponding visualizations (such as the Laplacian map for blur and block variance map for JPEG artifacts) are shown.
Output:
For each image, the following metrics are computed:

Gaussian Noise (Variance): A measure of Gaussian noise present in the image.
Salt-and-Pepper Noise Ratio: A ratio indicating the severity of salt-and-pepper noise.
Blur Metric: A value representing the sharpness of the image, with lower values indicating more blur.
JPEG Artifact Metric: A value indicating the presence of JPEG compression artifacts.
Requirements:
MATLAB (R2021 or later recommended)
