# Low-Light-Image-Enhancement-for-Medical-Imaging-applications
Objective:
This research seeks to develop a robust deep learning model specifically designed to enhance low-light medical images. By focusing on medical imaging in low-resource settings or environments where optimal lighting is unavailable, this work aims to improve the diagnostic quality and usability of images in healthcare applications.

Background and Motivation:
Medical imaging is foundational to accurate diagnosis and effective treatment planning. However, imaging in low-light conditions can severely compromise image quality, leading to reduced clarity, contrast, and overall diagnostic value. This issue is especially prevalent in resource-limited or remote environments where specialized equipment, controlled lighting, or frequent maintenance may not be feasible. Enhancing low-light images holds the potential to address these limitations, enabling better diagnostics and healthcare outcomes across various medical disciplines.In recent years, deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown significant success in image enhancement tasks, including denoising, contrast adjustment, and resolution improvement. Applying these methods to medical images captured in suboptimal lighting conditions could increase image clarity, enabling more accurate diagnoses and supporting a range of clinical applications such as telemedicine, mobile diagnostics, and emergency care.
